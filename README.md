# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-in-Julia
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), normal discriminant analysis (NDA), or discriminant function analysis is a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics and other fields, to find a linear combination of features that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. Here I wrote LDA solver code from scratch and successfully reproduced R’s and Python’s default LDA solver's result. Tested on IRIS, Penguin and MPG datasets
